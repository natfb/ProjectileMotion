#### Description:
Welcome to the Projectile Motion Simulator, a dynamic web application built with JavaScript, Vite, and Bootstrap. This project aims to provide an interactive and educational experience for understanding projectile motion.

#### User Interaction
1. Launch Parameters
The user-friendly interface includes input forms conveniently placed alongside the simulation canvas. Adjusting variables such as initial velocity and launch angle is straightforward, allowing users to observe the real-time effects on the projectile's path.

2. Real-time Outputs
Beneath the simulation, a table dynamically updates with key outputs at each moment in time. This feature provides users with a quantitative understanding of the projectile's behavior, reinforcing theoretical concepts.

3. Zoom Capability
A distinctive aspect of this simulator is the zoom functionality. Users can zoom in and out, enabling exploration of a broad spectrum of launch velocities. This unique feature facilitates a comprehensive study of projectile motion under varying conditions, catering to a diverse range of educational needs.

4. Reset Button
To enhance user control and convenience, a reset button is incorporated. Users can easily reset the simulation to its initial state, allowing for quick adjustments and repeated experimentation without reloading the page.

#### File Structure
1. index.html
This file serves as the entry point for the application. It incorporates Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and visually appealing layout. Bootstrap simplifies the styling process, providing a solid foundation for the user interface.

2. script.js
The logic of the simulator is encapsulated in this file. It orchestrates the animation of the canvas and manages the computation of projectile motion. Additionally, it dynamically updates the table displaying the simulation outputs.

3. style.css
While Bootstrap handles most of the styling, this file contains additional custom styles to fine-tune the aesthetics.

#### Design Choices
a. JavaScript for Logic
The decision to use JavaScript for the logic was driven by its versatility and compatibility with web development. Leveraging JavaScript allowed for real-time computation and seamless interaction with the HTML elements, providing a smooth user experience.

b. Vite for Development
Vite was chosen for its speed and efficiency in development. Its instant server start and rapid hot module replacement significantly improved the development workflow, ensuring quick iterations and a responsive simulator.

c. Bootstrap for Styling
Bootstrap streamlines the styling process, offering a consistent and responsive design across various devices. This choice was made to prioritize a clean and user-friendly interface without compromising on aesthetics.

d. Modularity in Script.js
Centralizing all logic in script.js promotes modularity, making it easier to maintain and extend the application. This design choice enhances code organization and readability, facilitating collaboration and future enhancements.

#### Conclusion
The Projectile Motion Simulator brings physics to life in a user-friendly manner, offering an engaging learning experience. By utilizing JavaScript, Vite, and Bootstrap, this project combines functionality, speed, and aesthetics, making it a valuable tool for both education and exploration.
